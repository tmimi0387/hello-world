# hello-world
My first repository

Hello everyone,

I started self-learning coding a little over six months ago. Recently I was on reddit and I read that it's really important to know how to use github. So here I am, learning github. I already have a few gists that I downloaded from jsbin. It will be fun to learn everything I can do on this platform, though.
